The brewing is either done slowly by drip or filter, French press or cafetière, percolator, etc., or done very quickly under pressure by an espresso machine, where the coffee is termed 'espresso'—slow-brewed coffees are generally regarded simply as 'coffee'. All coffee drinks are based on either coffee or espresso, in different strengths.",

Through it, the carbon dioxide liberated by the freshly roasted coffee beans can leave the hermetic container, but it does not allow the entrance of the oxygen that would take away its flavor. All Starbucks coffee sold in our 225g and 450g FlavorLock ™ containers is hermetically packaged within two hours of its roasting so that it stays fresh until you use it.",
